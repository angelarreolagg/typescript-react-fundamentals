# ✨ TypeScript & React Fundamentals

A structured repository focused on revisiting and reinforcing the core fundamentals of TypeScript and React simultaneously. This project serves as a deliberate refresher of essential concepts that benefit from being reviewed together, particularly in real-world frontend development scenarios.

The repository emphasizes concepts that are commonly misunderstood, overlooked, or require periodic reinforcement, rather than attempting to be an exhaustive guide. Topics that are already well understood or considered trivial are intentionally omitted in order to keep the focus on meaningful learning and technical clarity.

Through concise examples and practical use cases, this repository aims to strengthen foundational knowledge, improve code reliability, and promote a deeper understanding of how TypeScript enhances React applications in terms of type safety, maintainability, and scalability.

The primary objective is to consolidate fundamental concepts while encouraging clean architecture, clear typing strategies, and best practices commonly applied in professional React projects.
